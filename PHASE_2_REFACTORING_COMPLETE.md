## 🚀 **Next Steps (Phase 3)**

### **1. Responsive Testing** (Recommended)
Test all dashboards on these breakpoints:
- **Mobile**: 320px, 375px, 425px
- **Tablet**: 768px, 1024px
- **Desktop**: 1280px, 1440px, 1920px

**What to Test**:
- Tab navigation (should collapse to hamburger menu on mobile if needed)
- Stat cards (should stack properly: 1 column on mobile, 2 on sm, 3 on lg, 5 on xxxl)
- Tables (should be scrollable horizontally on mobile)
- Cards (should stack without horizontal overflow)
- Buttons (should have proper touch targets: 44x44px minimum)

### **2. Code Quality Improvements** (Optional)
- Remove unused variables (setEvents, setUsers, setConnections, etc.)
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- Add error boundaries for better error handling
- Add loading states for async operations

### **3. Supabase Integration** (Future)
- Replace mock data with real Supabase queries
- Implement real-time updates with Supabase subscriptions
- Add proper error handling for database operations
- Implement pagination for large datasets

### **4. Additional Enhancements** (Future)
- Add animations (fade-in, slide-in)
- Add skeleton loaders for loading states
- Add empty states for when there's no data
- Add search and filter functionality
- Add export functionality (CSV, PDF)
